## Phantom Staff Bot

An old bot utilized for [PhantomHQ](https://phantomhq.club), a revamp of an old 2019 server with the same name.

This bot was used for the Staff Server, so it has a basic staffing system (which of the time of writing this, I don't even actually remember how to use).

### Project details
This bot was made in [Discord Bot Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/682130/Discord_Bot_Maker/), a 10$ Steam game which allows you to visually edit programs. There are actions also used from the [DBM-Network/mods](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods) repository.

I'm not giving you a tutorial on how to import the files into the game, learn it yourself.

### Copyright
This "code" which is more like data is not licensed at all. Feel free to do whatever you want.

There isn't any person or company who will convince me to take down code I wasn't paid to make. I believe most software should be open source.
